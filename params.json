Only if you are willing to help and\r\n  contribute. **THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL**\r\n  See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n# Donate:\r\n\r\nIf you want to support development of this project, you can **donate BTC** to the following address:\r\n\r\n    18QEEJuR2ACAunMVeAxZ46o4QprxFKyGkw\r\n\r\nOr through the [bountysource fundraiser](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/551-clearskies-open-source-file-synchronization)\r\n\r\n# Dependencies:\r\n\r\n* boost >= 1.49\r\n* libboost-test-dev\r\n* libboost-filesystem (v3)\r\n* libsqlite3-dev\r\n* ninja  (ninja-build on debian)\r\n\r\n# Included dependencies:\r\n\r\n* libuv (vendor/libuv)\r\n* gyp (tools/gyp) WARNING: watch out for interactions with the installed system gyp modules! this\r\n  can produce errors as the python module search path might use the ones on the system instead of\r\n  the installed one.\r\n\r\n# Supported compilers:\r\n\r\nDevelopment is done with **GCC 4.8** and boost 1.54, so far this is the only compiler guaranteed to be able to\r\nbuild the project. (My development machine runs Debian GNU/Linux testing (jessie))\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in C++11, the compiler should support the features used from this\r\nstandard. The following compilers should also work:\r\n\r\n* GCC >= 4.7\r\n* Visual Studio 2013\r\n* Clang\r\n\r\nOur target is to support the following platforms in order of development effort: Linux, Android, Windows, Mac, iOS.\r\n\r\n# Build instructions:\r\n\r\n    ./build.sh\r\n    ./test.sh\r\n\r\n# Status of the project\r\n\r\n- Low level assembling of messages and payload completed\r\n- Implementing the CS protocol\r\n- Integrating required libraries\r\n- Implementing share infrastructure\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion group\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clearskies-dev\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
